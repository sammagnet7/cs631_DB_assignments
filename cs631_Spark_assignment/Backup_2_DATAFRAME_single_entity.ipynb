A lot, if we are talking about bamboo. Bamboo is essentially a type of grass, but its classification as a tree for 90 years prevented the northeast, which grows 67% of India’s bamboo, from exploiting it commercially unlike China, the only country with richer bamboo genetic resources. Follow The Hindu's comprehensive coverage of Budget 2018 here Now Budget 2018 has ignited farm hope for this tree-turned-grass which once fuelled insurgency in the northeastern states. The allocation of ₹1,290 crore for a restructured National Bamboo Mission (NBM) has raised hopes for a range of bamboo-based industries – from food professing to construction. “Bamboo is a wonder, multi-utility grass that more than 300 ethnic groups in the northeast have traditionally been using in every stages of life, from birth to death, besides it being a delicacy. Bamboo’s commercial journey began when it was struck off the list of trees by amending the Indian Forest Act last year,” said Chandra Mohan Patowary, Assam’s industry and commerce minister. If the ‘tree’ tag prevented tribal people from using bamboos in forestland – the Northeast has 25% of India’s forests – the lack of policy support never allowed commercial use of non-forest bamboo, experts said. “The Budget provision is one of the best initiatives to promote holistic development of bamboo. But the restructured NBM needs to be more focussed on value-chain management and value-addition of bamboo at community level which will bring more income to the bamboo farmers and bamboo processors,” Kamesh Salam, a former member of NBM, told The Hindu Called the green gold, the bamboo has often been in focus for the wrong reasons in the northeast. A rat famine triggered by flowering of this grass had in 1966 led to the creation of the Mizo National Front that metamorphosed into a political party two decades later. The flowering of bamboo every 50-55 years leads to dramatic increase in the population of rats that destroy crops triggering famine, locally called mautam. There have also been instances of bamboo cartels shedding blood while competing for limited commercial opportunities such as two paper plants in Assam that have been struggling to survive. But things for the grass began looking up last year when the Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur governments signed an agreement for supplying bamboo to the Assam-based Numaligarh Refinery’s upcoming bio-refinery. “Such initiatives will offer a permanent source of revenue generation to bamboo growers and communities owning bamboo groves,” Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |What’s in a name?

Bamboo is essentially a type of grass, but its classification as a tree for 90 years prevented the northeast, which grows 67% of India’s bamboo, from exploiting it commercially unlike China, the only country with richer bamboo genetic resources. Follow The Hindu's comprehensive coverage of Budget 2018 here Now Budget 2018 has ignited farm hope for this tree-turned-grass which once fuelled insurgency in the northeastern states. The allocation of ₹1,290 crore for a restructured National Bamboo Mission (NBM) has raised hopes for a range of bamboo-based industries – from food professing to construction. “Bamboo is a wonder, multi-utility grass that more than 300 ethnic groups in the northeast have traditionally been using in every stages of life, from birth to death, besides it being a delicacy. Bamboo’s commercial journey began when it was struck off the list of trees by amending the Indian Forest Act last year,” said Chandra Mohan Patowary, Assam’s industry and commerce minister.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |2018-08-17 04:59:05.119647|22623985  |National        |[{checksum -> cc8e72b390945e3400ea433a1def7e37, path -> full/ea3e04fa80c1ad159ea5cf03998102502debd88a.jpg, url -> https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article22625145.ece/ALTERNATES/FREE_1080/THJC-BAMBOO}]                 |\n",

Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, on the other hand, had compared the ambitious healthcare scheme to “kite flying without string”. Referring to the fall in Sensex, Mr. Gandhi tweeted, “In parliamentary language, the Sensex just placed a solid 800 point No Confidence Motion against Modi’s budget. #BasEkAurSaal.” Mr. Chidambaram too took to twitter to further his argument, made on Thursday, that the government had not provided budgetary support for the healthcare scheme. ‘No allocation’ “Yesterday [Thursday], I had said that the new healthcare scheme is a jumla (mere claim) with no money provided in the budget. Today, [the Finance Minister] has admitted that no money has been provided and he will ‘raise money in the future’. Perfect jumla,” Mr. Chidambaram tweeted. “Scheme without money is like flying a kite without a string. The kite flyer will say that the kite is flying, but there will be no kite and nothing will be flying.’’ Reacting to the proposed scheme, the Congress leader said, “The promise of Rs. 5 lakh per family for secondary and tertiary healthcare is a big jumla . The target group is 10 crore families. Assuming each family will avail of Rs 50,000 — one tenth of Rs 5 lakh — the amount required per year will be Rs 5 lakh crore.” He argued that if the insurance companies paid the bill, the estimated premium at ₹5,000 to ₹15,000 per family would require an outgo from ₹50,000 crore to ₹1.5 lakh crore per year. “Is the Finance Minister serious,” Mr. Chidambaram asked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |Chidambaram says healthcare scheme is ‘kite flying without string’                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |2018-08-17 04:54:13.157593|22637592  |National        |[{checksum -> a5b9c5107bd98dd4ecccaaa74888b6ca, path -> full/850a816cc3b3cc06fd1d2e09743b7057a4149658.jpg, url -> https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article22638445.ece/ALTERNATES/FREE_1080/02TH-THGRP-RAHUL}]            |\n",

Reiterating the government’s promise to double farmers’ income by 2022, Mr. Modi claimed that the budget allocation for agriculture between 2014-19 was ₹ 2.12 lakh crore, almost double the amount — ₹ 1.21 lakh crore — allocated in the previous five years by the UPA government. Worry-free now Because of the government’s efforts, farmers were now “chinta mukt” or worry-free, protected from nature’s fury by insurance schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, he said. Farmers, speaking from Krishi Vigyan Kendras, also praised various government schemes, with themes by location — organic farming in Sikkim, fish farming in West Bengal and crop insurance in Karnataka, for example. The event was the seventh in a series of interactions the Prime Minister has been having with beneficiaries of various schemes. It was described as “a direct dialogue with farmers across the country, in which various initiatives related to doubling the income of farmers by 2022 will also be discussed.” Of the 24 farmers who spoke to Mr. Modi during the interaction, only one raised any concerns regarding income. Speaking from Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh, Rajwinder Singh, who has been farming 15 acres of leased land for the last 20 years, told the Prime Minister that guidance on drip irrigation for his crop of melons had improved his returns. Noting the cauliflowers placed on the table in front of the farmer, the Prime Minister commented on their large size. “Yes, I have left rice and wheat farming and shifted to vegetables. But there are some problems,” said Mr. Singh. “Unlike the cost of inputs, which go up every year, income remains a constant.” At that point, the Prime Minister cut him off with assurances that government initiatives were helping farmers on this issue, and asked if any other farmer had anything to say. ‘Publicity trick’ Several critics slammed the scripted nature of the event. “A meaningful interaction with farmers would be to talk to those, whose family member committed suicide due to agrarian distress or those farmers who have a huge burden of debt,” tweeted Congress leader Ashok Gehlot, dismissing the event as a publicity trick. “It’s a misnomer to call that an interaction. It was a pre-scripted TV show, the Prime Minister was the anchor and the farmers were no more than props...Notice that no one asked the Prime Minister any questions,” said Yogendra Yadav, president of Swaraj India party. He accused the Prime Minister of ignoring the reality of the agricultural crisis in the country, where farmers were unable to get minimum support prices for their crops, despite government promises. “In the last four years, the Prime Minister has not once uttered the words ‘farmer suicide’ and he did not do it today either.” “Even while the Prime Minister was speaking on video this morning, 25 farmers in Tamil Nadu were being arrested as they gathered to protest against the forced acquisition of farmland for the 8-lane Chennai-Salem highway,” said Vijoo Krishnan, joint secretary of the CPI(M)-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha, speaking from that agitation at Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu. “This is what is actually happening to farmers on the ground.”|Critics call Modi’s video interaction a ‘pre-scripted TV show’ that failed to address suicides due to agrarian distress                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |2018-08-17 04:58:38.038469|24212508  |National        |[{checksum -> d099378c5ef27a8f5a9d09c8bc1119e2, path -> full/9da897a94532d59041350a2db2a6f6ed91874dbd.jpg, url -> https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/25yk80/article24212507.ece/ALTERNATES/FREE_1080/21TH-SUGARCANEFARMERS}]|\n",

In its report titled ‘Price Policy for Kharif Crops for the Marketing Season 2018-19,’ the CACP notes that the procurement mechanism is broken for most crops and for most farmers. “It has been observed that often farmers of remote areas do not have sufficient access to APMCs [Agricultural Produce Market Committees] and their potential market is local haats where their produce is sold below MSP,” says the report. “Strong procurement operations need to be expanded to neglected regions, particularly eastern and north eastern regions.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices says farmers must be able to sell at MSP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |2018-08-17 04:54:37.543912|24343126  |National        |[{checksum -> dfa1061581715619086af4ebc9266e5f, path -> full/0b3e2daae05f787a9fdad535a826aac8ee13aa9f.jpg, url -> https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/x145a2/article24343125.ece/ALTERNATES/FREE_1080/TH06KRAKHARIFCROP}]    |\n",

Mr. Modi, who heads a high-level ministerial panel on GST, said on Sunday that there was an intention to have only three slabs, but it would take some time as it was related to the States’ revenue. Reacting to questions raised by former Finance Minister P.

The decision has been taken by the GST Council in which Congress-led governments are also involved.” He said that after the implementation of GST, the council had to initially ensure no revenue loss and later, the rates on many items were gradually reduced with the stabilisation of revenue. He said the average monthly GST revenue was approximately ₹95,000 crore and hence, the rates were being reduced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |The number of GST slabs can be reduced to three from five for the convenience of consumers and businesses, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi.

An engineering graduate who had to go till the Supreme Court and even write to the President requesting mercy killing, Shanavi spoke on her plight. “Despite laws, the truth is that trans people have no reservation in jobs and the government, which is duty-bound to protect us, is pushing us into prostitution and begging. Why can’t the government reserve at least one seat for us and not force us to apply under male/female category.” On Wednesday, the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) organised a meeting in solidarity with Shanavi. At the meet, Shanavi, who belongs to Tuticorin, said despite being a qualified engineer, she was denied employment in over 20 companies. Finally she got a job with a company where she handled Air India’s customer support. She later applied for an Air India cabin crew post under the female category as there was no category for transgenders. “I was rejected thrice after my trans woman identity was revealed, for which I was also ridiculed,” she said. “I have no source of income and I continue to face discrimination,” she added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |‘Why can’t the government reserve at least one seat for us?’                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |2018-08-17 04:58:21.686558|24513874  |National        |[]                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

The couple — Shirin Shahana and and Fasal Musthafa — allegedly persuaded Akhila Asokan, alias Hadiya, a homeopathy student from Kerala, to convert to Islam. Ms. Hadiya’s parents had moved the Kerala High Court in 2016 alleging that she was radicalised to convert to Islam and forcibly married to a Muslim man. After the High Court annulled the marriage, her husband, Shafin Jahan, moved the Supreme Court, which asked the NIA to investigate the case. The apex court restored Ms. Hadiya’s marriage to Mr. Jahan on March 8 but allowed the NIA to continue with its ongoing investigation into any criminality involved. It asked the agency to steer clear of Ms. Hadiya’s choice to marry Mr. Jahan. Status report The NIA, in a status report to the SC, had said the agency had evidence that Hadiya was brainwashed by the couple who she met at Sathya Sarani, a religious institution affiliated to the Popular Front of India (PFI) in Mallapuram district. “We have located the couple in Yemen. They claim that they are pursuing some religious studies there. We will take help of local authorities to question them through video call, we don’t think they are going to come back to India anytime soon. They are likely to join the probe as they would want to clear their name from police records,” a senior NIA official said. The official said the NIA had examined a few members of the Sathya Sarani in the past few days. The agency said they spoke to six persons who said that none of them were enticed by monetary benefits to convert to Islam. The NIA said there were other methods used to convert them to Islam that included religious propaganda.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |NIA will quiz them through video call                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |2018-08-17 04:58:01.726428|24542634  |National        |[]                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

The government also made it clear that Rohingyas were “illegal migrants” and not “refugees.” Responding to a question in the Lok Sabha on Rohingya migrants, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said the advisory for enumeration had been sent. BSF to prevent entry “The Border Security Force (BSF) and Assam Rifles have also been sensitised over not allowing in more illegal immigrants,” he said. Responding to a question on deporting the migrants, Mr. Singh said his department was waiting for the enumeration process to be complete, after which it would be sent to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) who will in turn take it up with the government of Myanmar. Answering supplementary questions on the issue, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said there had been reports of Rohingya being involved in illegal activities, but did not share the nature of these activities. He informed the House that the 40,000 or so Rohingya in India were mostly found in Jammu and Kashmir, Hyderabad (Telangana), Mewat in Haryana and Tripura. Also Read Can India ignore the Rohingya crisis? India’s ‘soft approach’ In a response to concerns of inhumane treatment being meted out to the Rohingya, raised by Trinamool Congress’s Sugata Bose, who also questioned the government’s stand on not adhering to India’s traditional generosity towards refugees, Mr. Rijiju said India had been “most soft” in its approach to the issue. “We are not signatories to the UN Convention on Refugees but have our own laws and have been most soft on refugees. That does not mean that there should be no regulation of the system. We should take care of our citizens first before taking care of others. Through the MEA we have helped in camps in Bangladesh and even in Rakhine, the province in Myanmar from where the Rohingya hail.

Officials, however, told The Hindu that while July rains were less than expected, the shortfall was confined to the northeastern States and below normal rains were unlikely to impede agriculture production. It’s expected to take a call before the weekend on whether to stick to — or downgrade — its May 30 forecast. On Wednesday, private forecaster Skymet Weather said monsoon rains — June to September—would be at 92% of the historical Long Period Average (LPA) of 89 cm. It had earlier forecast rains to be “normal” or 100% of the LPA. The larger-than-anticipated shortfall in July and anticipated weak rains during the whole of August were key dampeners. The IMD hasn’t indicated any change in its numbers. On May 30, it said monsoon rains, overall, would be 97% of the LPA. July would see excess rains (101% of that month’s LPA) and August would see a shortfall (94% LPA), it said. “We are reviewing the situation, and will soon issue a statement. The monsoon has spread well to all the agriculturally important regions,” said K.J. Ramesh, Director General of IMD. At the start of the monsoon, weather agencies around the world had indicated that the weather conditions in the Indian Ocean wouldn’t be very helpful to the monsoon, particularly after July. However, fears of an El Nino, an anomalous warming of the Central Pacific that frequently dries up monsoon rains in northwest India, also sharply receded. Madhavan Rajeevan, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, said, “If you ignore the northeastern States, it’s actually above average rainfall in the rest of India. Regions of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, which had been registering deficit rains, have also improved. So it’s not a situation to worry about.” Decline in sowing? Estimates from the Agriculture Ministry suggest a decline in sowing from last year. Paddy farmers in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have sown almost 20 lakh hectares less than normal for this point in the kharif season; in Bihar, paddy acreage is only 40% of the acreage sown at the same time last year. According to data from the Ministry, kharif crops have been sown on almost 738 lakh hectares till July 27. That is a 7.5% drop from the previous year. Sowing of most major crops has been slower than last year, with the exceptions being soya bean, moong and sugarcane. But the situation in the country's reservoirs is better. The total water available in 91 reservoirs in the country, being monitored by Central Water Commission (CWC), was 63.333 BCM (billion cubic metre) as on July 26. This is 41% of the total live storage capacity of these reservoirs and 116% of storage of average of last 10 years. “The overall storage position is better than the corresponding period of last year,” the CWC said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |Shortfall unlikely to impede agriculture, officials say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |2018-08-17 04:55:09.916531|24584860  |National        |[{checksum -> 09f53d4e7ec05817b7084b2a6fb3b39c, path -> full/c4d1f3ff35775bf2dd2bca8e4866ddb2cdd9d0a0.jpg, url -> https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k7ejao/article24584859.ece/ALTERNATES/FREE_1080/03THRAIN}]             |\n",

The number, 1800-300-1947, was saved under the name ‘UIDAI’ and is the toll-free helpline of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the statutory body in charge of Aadhaar. But what triggered confusion was the fact that it had entered people’s phone books without their knowledge and consent. Panic on Twitter It all began with a simple question from a French security expert, Robert Baptiste, who goes by the pseudonym, Elliot Alderson on Twitter. “Do you have @UIDAI in your contact list by default?” he tweeted on Thursday. When a flood of replies confirmed that they did, he tweeted again, “I’m thinking aloud: What if it is only the top of the iceberg?” Users began posting screenshots of their contacts list with the number and sought explanations from @UIDAI on how it got added to their phones without their consent. “So, the #UIDAI is automatically a contact in my phone-book. Creepy much…?” tweeted a user. The UIDAI, service providers, and handset providers all denied responsibility. UIDAI even tweeted that “some vested interest are trying to create unwarranted confusion in the public”. Google clarifies The mystery of how the number got into entered users’ contacts list was eventually resolved when Google owned up to it. “Our internal review has revealed that in 2014, the then UIDAI helpline number and the 112 distress helpline number were inadvertently coded into the SetUp wizard of the Android release given to OEMs [Original Equipment Manufacturers] for use in India and has remained there since. Since the numbers get listed on a user’s contact list, these get transferred accordingly to the contacts on any new device,” clarified a Google spokesperson. “We would like to assure everyone that this is not a situation of an unauthorised access of their Android devices. Users can manually delete the number from their devices,” he said, adding that this issue would be fixed in the upcoming version of SetUp wizard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |Discovery of the authority’s toll free number in mobile phones triggers panic over surveillance, privacy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |2018-08-17 04:58:24.702502|24596127  |National        |[{checksum -> 28afd1738061b4800d75a1bf8a7c70f7, path -> full/ccbd0e888e2b74d70a20d52366ef99b81b6c802d.jpg, url -> https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yo43l5/article24596126.ece/ALTERNATES/FREE_1080/man%20surprised}]      |\n",

Top leaders said discussions on the Prime Ministerial candidate is divisive at this stage. “So the focus is to have one platform where every like-minded Opposition party can be accommodated without any confusion and disruption.” Leaving the choice of a PM candidate for post-poll discussions is significant as already West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has positioned herself as the front-runner. BSP chief Mayawati too has not shied away from expressing her prime ministerial ambitions if the grand alliance does well in Uttar Pradesh. Also Read Our first aim is to oust BJP from power: Mamata The Congress is of the view that alliances and pre-poll understanding in States such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra are crucial in the Opposition’s effort to stop PM Narendra Modi. Party leaders claim that the alliance in Maharashtra with Sharad Pawar’s NCP is cemented and so is the case with Lalu Prasad’s RJD in Bihar. But in Uttar Pradesh, which elects 80 Lok Sabha members, the party is yet to stitch up a grand alliance with the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) has authorized Congress chief Rahul Gandhi \"to have alliances with like minded parties. Top leaders admit that conversations are on for a tie up in Uttar pradesh even as they denied media reports that Congress may be offered no more than two or three seats in the State on the basis of its strength. Congress pins hopes on Hindi heartland The party is looking at Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Haryana among States where it expects to do well in next Lok Sabha polls. And that will help catapult it to the centre-stage of an opposition alliance. In States like Delhi and Punjab, where the Congress and AAP are on the same side in their opposition the Modi government, top leadership of the Congress will give priority to the views of the State unit. Despite its now strident opposition to the BJP, the Congress will not have any understanding with Shiv Sena since their ideologies don't align. Senior leaders of the Congress are of the view that if the BJP doesn't get 230 seats or more on its own, NDA allies may prefer another Prime Ministerial candidate over Mr Narendra Modi. Top leaders of the Congress asserted that despite attempts to tie them down in a polarising discourse, the Congress would run a campaign that would focus on a new deal for farmers, jobs and opportunities for India's youth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Focus is on bringing like-minded parties on one platform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |2018-08-17 04:55:11.637600|24596306  |National        |[{checksum -> 62774f7e3e34f163bfcdd168131d658c, path -> full/4f4da3debbdb7f7f0e9e89e81cccb9df510f5ad7.jpg, url -> https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jvy37u/article24596311.ece/ALTERNATES/FREE_1080/PMsjpg}]               |\n",

A Bench headed by Justice Madan B Lokur directed the owners of the other resorts and hotels located in the area to place their documents of approval before the Collector within 24 hours. The apex court said the Collector will verify the documents and if he arrives at the conclusion that a resort or hotel has been constructed without prior approval, the same should also be closed down within 48 hours. The Bench, also comprising justices S Abdul Nazeer and Deepak Gupta, said elephants were our “national heritage” and expressed displeasure as to how constructions had come up on the elephant corridor of Nilgiris. Also Read SC urged to issue directions to protect elephant corridor During an earlier hearing, one of the counsels for the petitioners had alleged that several hotels and resorts had come up in the elephant corridor areas of Tamil Nadu. The Bench had made it clear that no construction activity would be carried out in those areas of the southern state and asked the Collector of the Nilgiris area, where the hotels and resorts have come up, to file a report in this regard. It had also asked the Collector to inform the court as to how these establishments could be identified, when were they built and how. The counsel had also told the court that around 18,000 elephants came to Tamil Nadu during the monsoon season and the court should direct that the power connection to these resorts and hotels be snapped. The owners of some of these hotels and resorts have also filed appeals in the apex court against a Madras High Court order against them in this regard. The apex court had earlier said it was “extremely unfortunate” that several states had not responded to two communications sent by the Centre on the issue of elephant corridors to curb incidents of human-animal conflict and reduce animal fatalities. Also Read Proposed Nilgiris elephant corridor runs into resistance The Centre had told the court that a committee was formed to consider the suggestions, including making corridors across the country for the safe passage of elephants and other endangered animals. The apex court had stressed on the need to have elephant corridors across the country to reduce animal fatalities due to accidents and other reasons and asked the Centre to come up with some “workable solution” in this regard. The Centre had told the court that there were 27 “critical” elephant corridors in 22 states, but despite the top court’s directions, 13 of those states had not responded to the government on the matter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |Owners of hotels and resorts in the area asked to submit documents of approval to the Collector                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |2018-08-17 04:53:47.379988|24640844  |National        |[{checksum -> d06e3f0f45677d38492c392798ea97bd, path -> full/233b0309fee5477185d33be2f9ac08f227c0d044.jpg, url -> https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/85awoc/article24640843.ece/ALTERNATES/FREE_1080/IN08ELEPHANTCORRIDOR}] |\n",

Aarushi was found with her throat slit in her bedroom and Hemraj's body was found on the terrace of the dentist couple's home a day later. Hemraj's wfe, Khumkala Banjade, had appealed against the acquittal by the Allahabad High Court in October 2017 in December last and the Supreme Court admitted it. A Bench, led by Justice Ranjan Gogoi, granted leave to the CBI appeal and tagged it along with Ms. Banjade's appeal. The CBI, which filed the appeal in March last, has said the High Court had erred on many counts. Also Read Aarushi murder case: a timeline of events In a stinging judgment, the High Court had set aside the life sentence awarded to the couple on November 26, 2013 by the CBI court at Ghaziabad. The Talwars had already served four years of their life sentence in Ghaziabad’s Dasna jail. The suspicion in the murder of 14-year-old Aarushi initially fell on the 45-year-old Hemraj, as he had gone missing. But his body was found on the terrace of the house the next day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |Domestic help Hemraj's wife Khumkala Banjade has already appealed against their acquittal by Allahabad High Court in October 2017 and Supreme Court has admitted it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |2018-08-17 04:55:09.664732|24652776  |National        |[{checksum -> 13a489de0ff3e4b007d10233bcccb58c, path -> full/0bcddb142f0c03e0a0a96c698dee3f17d0e6bb1c.jpg, url -> https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/1qowsr/article11718795.ece/ALTERNATES/FREE_1080/TALWARS-01}]       |\n",

Which individual professors are blazing new trails in, say, climate change research here? The Union science ministry’s communication wing, Vigyan Prasar, has launched the India Science Technology and Innovation portal that can help with such queries. Currently the portal can be queried for information about the organisations carrying out research, those funding them, international collaborations, the scientists involved in the research, the states in which they are being carried out, their achievements and impact. Prime focus There’s also a compilation of technologies developed in India, the organisations that have developed these technologies, those that have funded them and the status of the technologies. “A major thrust of the portal is to reach out to students, researchers, scholars, scientists both from India and abroad, so that they can choose from the mine of fellowships, scholarships and funding and startup opportunities that India puts on their plate,” says a note accompanying the portal. The portal follows a launch this week of India Science (indiascience.in), an Internet-based science channel, to showcase the developments in science and technology in India. Both the portal and the channel are part of a push by the Science Ministry to improve its public outreach. By next year, the Ministry hopes to offer science programmes on Doordarshan and eventually launch a dedicated science channel. According to a roadmap prepared by the Union government, the Science Ministry proposes to spend ₹15 crore over five years to cover costs of portal development and updates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |There’s also a compilation of technologies developed in India, the organisations that have developed these technologies and the status of the technologies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |2018-08-17 04:58:25.587571|24657313  |National        |[]                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

The session saw 17 sittings, with August 8 seeing a notable adjournment to pay homage to the former chief minister of Tamil Nadu M. Karunanidhi who passed away the previous day. This Monsoon session of Parliament was the “most productive” for Lok Sabha since 2000, PRS Legislative Research has said. The productivity of Lok Sabha was 118% and that of Rajya Sabha was 68%, according to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. As many as 22 Bills (21 in the Lok Sabha and one in the Rajya Sabha)were introduced. The Lok Sabha passed 21 Bills while the Rajya Sabha passed 14 Bills during the session. There are two more reasons for the government to cheer.

This Monsoon session of Parliament was the “most productive” for Lok Sabha since 2000, PRS Legislative Research has said. The productivity of Lok Sabha was 118% and that of Rajya Sabha was 68%, according to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs. As many as 22 Bills (21 in the Lok Sabha and one in the Rajya Sabha)were introduced. The Lok Sabha passed 21 Bills while the Rajya Sabha passed 14 Bills during the session.

You can oppose, Congress party’s leader Rahul Gandhi can oppose, but our commitment is to complete the process of NRC in Assam in a judicious manner,” he said at a Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha meeting. Mr. Shah accused the Trinamool Congress chairperson of creating confusion about the NRC in West Bengal. He referred to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, brought by the BJP-led government, and said it had the provision to provide citizenship to Hindus, Buddhists and Christians who had come from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. “The Government of India will ensure that asylum seekers are allowed to stay in the country,” he said. Mr. Shah recalled Ms. Banerjee’s opposition to “illegal infiltration” in 2005, and alleged that she had taken a U-turn as the “infiltrators” were now voting for the Trinamool Congress. “Mamata ji , you will have to make your stand clear before the people of the State, whether you are for infiltrators or for national security,” he said. Unlike the State leadership of the party, which has been claiming that the BJP will initiate a similar process of NRC in West Bengal if it comes to power, the BJP president did not make any such claims. However, he alleged that the way infiltration is taking place, “West Bengal will turn into West Bangladesh”. He gave a call to “uproot” the Trinamool Congress from power. Observing that the people of the State had “given a chance to the Congress, the communists and the Trinamool Congress,” he urged them to give an opportunity to the BJP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |In Kolkata, BJP chief flays Congress president, Mamata over NRC.r                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |2018-08-17 04:54:10.960829|24663961  |National        |[]                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

They set out to collect fresh buffalo milk from the homesteads run by women like Narangi and Laxmi. After a cursory examination to catch any dilution of the milk, the men move to the next door. By 5.30 a.m., the morning’s collection is loaded onto an autorickshaw for transport to the Inchhapuri railway station, 10 km away. It’s another two hours by train to Delhi. Each milkman collects 50 to 200 litres a day, and 300 to 350 of them travel daily from Asadpur, Rojka, Malahera, Shahpur, Khalilpur, Doki Dabri, Pataudi and Jhatola villages of Haryana to Delhi to distribute milk in various parts of the city. Though Mother Dairy and Amul dominate the milk market, an informal network of milkmen from Haryana has a sizeable clientele, selling 40,000 litres. “When I began selling milk in 1986, milk was retailing at ₹3 a litre. Now it is ₹45.

They set out to collect fresh buffalo milk from the homesteads run by women like Narangi and Laxmi. After a cursory examination to catch any dilution of the milk, the men move to the next door. By 5.30 a.m., the morning’s collection is loaded onto an autorickshaw for transport to the Inchhapuri railway station, 10 km away. It’s another two hours by train to Delhi. Each milkman collects 50 to 200 litres a day, and 300 to 350 of them travel daily from Asadpur, Rojka, Malahera, Shahpur, Khalilpur, Doki Dabri, Pataudi and Jhatola villages of Haryana to Delhi to distribute milk in various parts of the city. Though Mother Dairy and Amul dominate the milk market, an informal network of milkmen from Haryana has a sizeable clientele, selling 40,000 litres. “When I began selling milk in 1986, milk was retailing at ₹3 a litre. Now it is ₹45. Neither the demand nor the supply shows signs of abating,” Rajesh Kumar, 51, of Asadpur says. “The journey from the village to the railway station and to the final destination can be mapped, thanks to mobile phones which are extremely useful in our line of business.” Text and images by R.V.

Ahead of the Assembly polls in three BJP-ruled States — Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh — some relief for Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) is likely. A possible exemption from filing for firms with a turnover of up to ₹5 crore is said to be in the offing. Senior sources in the GST Council told The Hindu that during the last meeting of the Council, it was decided that rate cuts etc. were not the route to take to give relief to the MSME sector; instead exemptions from the GST ambit for firms with a turnover of upto ₹5 crore could be the way to go. “Several States, specifically Gujarat and Delhi, have asked that exemptions be given for MSMEs with a turnover of upto ₹5 crore, whereas some other States have asked [that] the limit be for firms of upto ₹1.5 lakh,” said a source. The decision may be announced in the next meeting of the Council on September 28 in Goa — close to polling in the three States, scheduled for the end of the year. Union Minister Arun Jaitley is expected to be back at the helm of affairs at the Finance Ministry by then. At the last meeting of the Council, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal had said all suggestions from various States should be collated and considered. Madhya Pradesh with 26.74 lakh firms and Rajasthan with 26.87 lakh have a huge MSME presence and the any relief to the sector, currently dissatisfied with cumbersome filing procedures, would be politically important. “Rate cuts in the context of MSMEs have been dismissed as not workable and these cuts will affect not just these units but bigger suppliers etc. Exemptions from tax and filing procedures will have a more direct impact in terms of giving relief,” said a member of the GST Council.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |MSMEs with a turnover of up to ₹5 crore may be exempted from filing returns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |2018-08-17 04:57:04.527597|24682505  |National        |[{checksum -> 4b242752e9c52233597e804271f31642, path -> full/392bbd2e6e08a07576de9d85a0897e99408916ba.jpg, url -> https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ain62k/article24682504.ece/ALTERNATES/FREE_1080/13TH-THGRP-SSI}]       |\n",
